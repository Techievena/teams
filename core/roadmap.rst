Roadmap
-------

I don't really think a strict roadmap is the way forward. They are quite
cumbersome and suck the joy out of open-source. However, I do believe in having
a broad and overarching plan detailing how things could play out.

Obviously, these are quite volatile. They are subject to change frequently and
you shouldn't rely on this at all. A better and more complete list would be the
`coala issue tracker <https://github.com/coala/coala/issues>`_.

Major Future Features
=====================

aspects
*******

aspects are a completely new way to code analysis. You can read more about this
in `cEP #5 <https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md>`_. The
aspects team (leader: `Stefan Zimmermann <https://github.com/userzimmermann>`_)
is responsible for this project and handles all decisions.

Various Performance Enhancements
********************************

Despite various improvements in the past, coala has a lot of room for
improvement when it comes to speed. We spend a lot of CPU time in unnecessary
operations and optimizing these can give huge margins.

Next-gen Design
***************

This is an ongoing work. You can read more about it in
`cEP #2 <https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0002.md>`_.

Supporting Tools' Improvements
******************************

coala-quickstart and coala-html are fairly advanced (although there's still a
lot of work to be done). But they are no where near the desired usage; so this
project aims to investigate and develop ways we can improve on that area.
